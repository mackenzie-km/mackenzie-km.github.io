Hello & welcome! My name is Mackenzie.

I first got interested in web development over a decade ago. I learned a lot about HTML and CSS before college.

But somewhere along the way, I got confused. In high school, I fell in love with English literature. In college, I became an animal science major. After college, I tried to work in the sciences. I got bored.

While I was bored, I learned that my laboratory used SQL as a database. My coworker and I pretended to be coders, finding ways to use SQL to improve our data queries. I quickly learned that a little technical know-how can revolutionize your day-to-day tasks. Through many conversations, and a TON of Flatiron pre-work, I decided that I was going to become a web developer once my laboratory contract ended.

So now I'm back - and I'm ready to learn! I'm looking forward to using my mind, numbers, and letters to collaborate and solve problems creatively.
