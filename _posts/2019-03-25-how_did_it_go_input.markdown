My CLI/Gem project is 95% complete. (Pending submission/review).


My takeaways:

1) Flatiron has prepared us well. I actually knew what I was doing. In fact, I didn't realize until AFTER I completed my project that there were additional videos/resources that I could have watched. 

2) Github is amazing. Now that I understand the how and the why, I love it.

3) CLI Applications are limited. As the end goal is for the user to see some data from a webpage, I felt disappointed by the ouput. I also felt disappointed by the webpage I was using to scrape data. I wish there was a greater variety of data.


Disappointment just gets me excited for future lessons - and for APIs!
