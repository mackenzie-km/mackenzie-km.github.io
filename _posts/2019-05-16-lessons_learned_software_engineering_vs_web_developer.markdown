In the middle of an interview yesterday, I was asked why I chose full stack web development over software engineering. I think I gave a terrible answer.

The good news: that interview wasn't life or death; I didn't even expect to interview this early on in my bootcamp process. 

The even better news: I'll be more prepared next time!

Here are some brief thoughts on the topic - why I chose it, and how they're even different.


They're similar:
> Every web developer who is employable is a software engineer. -[Firehose Project](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/software-engineer-vs-web-developer/)
So - they ARE similar! They're both programmers, and they both share a similar skill set of coding.

But the skill set is more narrow for web development:
> One difference, however, is that web development...requires a more-limited skill set than software development. A working understanding of a few specific programming languages, such as JavaScript or Java, and a clear idea of the business end-goals of the webpages in question are often enough.

When considering how they're different, I need to remember the difference in the programming languages required. 

>  Most software developers need to complete at least a bachelorâ€™s degree, during which time they learn not only programming code, but also computer fundamentals, computer architecture, and data structure.

With software development, it's a more broad term. There's a lot more to dig deep in and learn, and I could spend 4+ years learning it in school.


In conclusion, I know why I chose full stack dev. I chose full stack web development because it is a growing industry (everything's moving mobile!), and there are more resources for me to get started. 
Perhaps someday I will dig deeper in software development/engineering and broaden my knowledge.
