I was really disappointed with the has_secure_password section because I didnâ€™t feel prepared for all the concepts introduced in the lab. So hereâ€™s a blog post about some of the steps I took to navigate these concepts.

What the heck? SessionsController? How does this interact with UsersController?
1. Get some more background knowledge. I checked out [this wordy](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/basic_login) (but helpful) guide in seciton 8.1.1 to learn more about what SessionsController was intended for. I also read around some other sections on the page as a refresher on sessions and routes.
    1. I learned that SessionsController really should be the controller that manages sessions#new (login page), sessions#create (setting your session_id), and sessions#destroy (the logout feature)
    2. What does this leave UsersController for, then? users#new should be a sign-up page. users#create should create a new user if the passwords match. 

Preparing to use has_secure_password 
1. Add the bcrypt gem to your Gemfile
2. Run bundle install & update
3. Create your users table (remember NOT to make a password column - this isnâ€™t secure. Make a password_digest column so that bcrypt can save only the salted and hashed password digest)
4. Run your migrations 
5. Create your user model & play around with it in console to make sure itâ€™s working as expected
6. Add has_secure_password to your user model 
Woop woop - now you have access to methods like password & password_confirmation to verify your password!! You also have access to things like authenticate to make sure that the userâ€™s submitted password matches the expected password.

How do I make new users? (This should be a lot of review!)
1. Set up my UsersController
    1. class UsersController < ApplicationController
        1. def new 
        2. end 
        3. def create 
        4. end 
    1. end 
2. Set up my user routes for submitting and creating a user in the database 
    1. get '/users/new', to: "users#new"
    2. post '/users', to: "users#create"
3. I made the user/new view with a nice create a user form 
    1. <%= form_for :user, url: â€˜/users' do |f| %>
    2.   Username: <%= f.text_field :name %>
    3.   Password: <%= f.password_field :password %>
    4.   Password Confirmation: <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
    5.   <%= f.submit "Submit" %>
    6. <% end %>
4. Now, my tests can go to create a new user. The data is getting pushed into the UsersController users#create action. So it was time to set up my create action. I wanted to make sure I saved a user to the database, and that it redirected me to try again if it didnâ€™t work. If it did work, I wanted the user to be logged in.
    1. @user = User.new(user_params)
    2.     if !@user.save
    3.       redirect_to '/users/new'
    4.     else
    5.       session[:user_id] = @user.id
    6.       redirect_to "/"
    7.     end
    1. NOTE: I also added strong params to the bottom of this section: params.require(:user).permit(:name, :password, :password_confirmation)â€¦. isnâ€™t that cool how the password_confirmation is a nice given method with you when you do has_secure_password ðŸ™‚

Iâ€™m in!! Yes!!! But next time I visit this pageâ€¦ Iâ€™m gonna need to login & logout. Iâ€™m going to need a sessions controller.

How do I set up my SessionsController for submitting, creating, and destroying a session in the browser?
    1. class SessionsController < ApplicationController
        1. def new 
        2. end 
        3. def create 
        4. end 
        5. def destroy
        6. end 
    2. end 
1. I used that guide to set up my routes 
    1. get    '/login',   to: 'sessions#new'
    2. post   '/login',   to: 'sessions#create'
    3. delete '/logout',  to: 'sessions#destroy'
2. I made the session/new view & I copied the same create user form into the session/new view 
    1. <%= form_for :user, url: â€˜/login' do |f| %>
    2.   Username: <%= f.text_field :name %>
    3.   Password: <%= f.password_field :password %>
    4.   Password Confirmation: <%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %>
    5.   <%= f.submit "Submit" %>
    6. <% end %>
3. Now, when the tests ran, there was a sessions#new form to view. That form would post to sessions#create. Sessions create now could use the data. So I set up the create action. (I have to admitâ€¦ I had to look at the solution at this part. I was starting to lose my mind. Iâ€™m going to leave something out thatâ€™s too solution-specific.)
    1. The first step is to find the user so you can later compare credentials - use a User.find_by
    2. Then you need to actually try to authenticate them ([a fun note on try!!](https://apidock.com/rails/v3.2.1/Object/try) - user = user.try(:authenticate, params[:user][:password])
    3. Then you would to check and see if the user was authenticated or not. 
        1. You will need to redirect_to the users#new action (to make a new user) or the login page (try again) if not. 
        2. If they were authenticated, try to set session[:user_id] to the userâ€™s id. Redirect them to your homepage or wherever!
4. To let the user logout, go into sessions#destroy to use the .delete method on the session[:user_id], and redirect them to your homepage 

Fixing this implementation of my SessionsController made all of my tests turn green. Cross checking the solution, this seems to be mostly accurate. This may not be 100% accurate, but doing all of this really helped me to start building a conceptual foundation!
