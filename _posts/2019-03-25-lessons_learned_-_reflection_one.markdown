Hello! I want to start utilizing this blog as a "lessons learned repository."

The goal is to post at least one lesson learned per week.

***

I think the most important lesson I learned recently was to debug by checking line by line. This can be accomplished via pry, or by stubbing data into your methods. 

This was critical for me in building my CLI application. I learned this the hard way after wasting HOURS on one method in TicTacToe with AI. My boolean statements weren't set up properly, and I didn't realize it until I checked line by line.

Jumping around and trying out various theories is NOT effective. I need a more systematic approach.

Pry line by line. As we used to say in Genentech - trust... but verify.
